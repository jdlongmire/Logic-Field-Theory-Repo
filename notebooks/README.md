# üìö Logic Field Theory (LFT) ‚Äî Simulation Notebooks

Welcome to the **Logic Field Theory (LFT)** simulation notebooks repository.  
This folder contains finalized simulations supporting the Logic Field Theory research effort.  
Each notebook addresses a specific aspect of LFT's formalism, predictions, or comparison to standard quantum mechanics.

## üìÇ Folder Overview

Each file is named systematically:

- `X.0-Description.ipynb` ‚Üí Core foundational or major simulation modules
- `Sim-Y-Description.ipynb` ‚Üí Specialized or progressive simulation modules
- Other descriptive names are used for comparative studies (e.g., LFT vs QM Weak Measurement)

## ‚ú® Purpose of These Simulations

- **Formal Verification:** Validate the theoretical structure of LFT through simulated logical projections.
- **Paradox Resolution:** Demonstrate LFT‚Äôs resolution of key quantum paradoxes (EPR, GHZ, Kochen-Specker, Bell).
- **Empirical Comparison:** Provide measurable deviations or confirmations compared to standard quantum mechanical predictions.
- **Theory Visualization:** Use graphs and statistical outputs to visually represent logical constraints and outcomes.
