# üß† Logic Field Theory (LFT)

Welcome to the Logic Field Theory (LFT) research repository.  
LFT is a novel scientific framework that refines quantum mechanics by introducing logic-first constraints on state realization.

This repository contains simulation notebooks, formal definitions, and early empirical projections supporting the development and testing of Logic Field Theory.

## ‚ú® What is Logic Field Theory?

Logic Field Theory (LFT) proposes that:

- Fundamental logic (identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle) constrains physical state space.
- Quantum phenomena emerge from logical projection filtering, not fundamental randomness.
- Measurement outcomes reveal pre-existing logical constraints rather than collapsing indeterminate states.

This approach offers resolutions to key quantum paradoxes (EPR, GHZ, Bell, Kochen-Specker) while preserving empirical consistency with quantum mechanics.
