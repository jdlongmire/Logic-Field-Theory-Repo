Logic Field Theory (LFT) posits that physical reality (Ω) is the dynamic manifestation of fundamental logical constraints—the Three Fundamental Logical Laws (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle)—acting on the manifold of information states (S), succinctly:  
\[
\Omega = L(S).
\]

## 🌟 Purpose & Mission

**Purpose:**  
To establish that logic precedes and constrains physics: measurement outcomes and state evolution emerge from prescriptive logical laws rather than intrinsic randomness.

**Mission:**  
- Rigorously derive LFT’s mathematical formalism and demonstrate its internal consistency.  
- Produce testable empirical predictions (collapse dynamics, Bell‐basis biases, tunneling deviations, mixed‐state anomalies).  
- Provide fully executable notebooks and validated simulations that any researcher can reproduce.  
- Prepare LFT for peer‐reviewed publication by transparently sharing all code, data, and manuscripts.
