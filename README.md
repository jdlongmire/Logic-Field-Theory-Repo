# Logic Field Theory (LFT) Simulation Suite

This repository contains the full simulation suite supporting the Logic Field Theory (LFT) framework developed by James D. (JD) Longmire.

LFT proposes that fundamental logical constraints—not randomness—govern the manifestation of physical reality, refining standard quantum mechanics.

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: Core simulations (PiL, EPR, GHZ, KS, Bell, Born Rule, Weak Measurement)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Open notebooks in your favorite environment (Colab, Jupyter, etc.)
